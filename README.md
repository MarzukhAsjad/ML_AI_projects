Files that are created using Collaboratory should be run on Google collaboratory since the dependencies and libraries used in those files are directly imported from google Colab's built in libraries.
Other files can be run using the environment from requirements.txt. The dependencies can be installed in a virtual environment or your local environment of choice. 

Installation of dependencies via the following command in python terminal: <br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# NLP
Some Natural Language Processing programs are also being created. 

To run the python files, the requirements.txt has the information on the environment.
